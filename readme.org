This Emacs configuration stays as close as humanly bearable to Vanilla Emacs.
- Relies on Emacs 29.1
- Standard keyboard shortcuts
- No configuration for developing software
- Centred around Org mode

This website will eventually be published in an (e)book with an extended version of the website. The website and the book are written and published with the /Emacs Writing Studio/ Configuration.
