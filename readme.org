This configuration follows the following principles:
- Leverage functionality in Emacs 29.1
- Standard keyboard shortcuts
- No configuration for writing code
- Centred around Org mode

The [[https://lucidmanager.org/tags/emacs/][accompanying website]] will eventually be published as an (e)book with additional content. The website and the book are written and published with the /Emacs Writing Studio/ Configuration.

Feel free to raise an issue if you have any suggestions on how to enhance the configuration or like to see additional packages useful to authors.

* Install EWS
To run the /Emacs Writing Studio/ configuration, download the ~init.el~ file and run Emacs with the ~--init-directory~ option followed by the folder where =init.el= is located:

~emacs --init-directory <path/to/emacs-writing-studio>~

The Documents folder contains some sample documents and a testing script.

EWS checks for the presence of required external software and will generate a warning if one or more programs are missing.

* Using EWS
/Emacs Writing Studio/ uses the standard Emacs key bindings. For commands without defualt keybinding, it uses the =C-c w= prefix keys (=w= for writing).

** EWS Functions
/Emacs Writing Studio/ includes bespoke convenience commands:

- ~ews-biblio-lookup~: Combines functionality from the [[https://github.com/cpitclaudel/biblio.el][biblio]] and [[https://github.com/emacs-citar/citar][Citar]] packages.
- ~ews-distraction-free~: Activate [[https://github.com/rnkn/olivetti][Olivetti mode]].
- ~ews-org-insert-notes-drawer~: Inserts a notes drawer under the current Org heading.
