#+title: Emacs Writing Studio
#+author: Peter Prevos

/Emacs Writing Studio/ is configuration and a [[https://lucidmanager.org/tags/emacs/][series of articles]] on how authors can use Emacs to publish articles, books, scripts and websites.

This Emacs configuration stays as close as humanly bearable to Vanilla Emacs.

- Leverages functionality in Emacs 29.1
- Standard keyboard shortcuts
- No configuration for developing software
- Centred around Org mode

To try the /Emacs Writing Studio/, download the ~init.el~ file and run Emacs with the ~--init-directory~ option followed by the folder where =init.el= is located:

~emacs --init-directory emacs-writing-studio~

The accompanying website will eventually be published in an (e)book. The website and the book are written and published with the /Emacs Writing Studio/ Configuration.
