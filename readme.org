This configuration follows the following principles:
- Leverage functionality in Emacs 29.1
- Standard keyboard shortcuts
- No configuration for writing code
- Centred around Org mode

Feel free to raise an issue if you have any suggestions on how to enhance the configuration or like to see additional packages useful to authors.

* Install EWS
To try /Emacs Writing Studio/ configuration, download the =init.el= file and run Emacs with the =--init-directory= option followed by the init directory.

~emacs --init-directory <path/to/emacs-writing-studio>~

Emacs requires external software to assist with reading and manipulating non-text files, such as ebooks, images and sound files. EWS checks for the presence of required external software and will generate a warning in the =*Messages*= buffer if one or more programs are missing. If this is the case, some functionality might not be available, but Emacs will work fine otherwise.

* Using EWS
/Emacs Writing Studio/ uses default Emacs key bindings. For commands without default keybinding, it uses the =C-c w= prefix keys (=w= for Writing Studio).

Read the [[https://lucidmanager.org/tags/emacs/][accompanying website]] for a detailed description of its functionality.
