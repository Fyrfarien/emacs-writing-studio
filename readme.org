#+TITLE: Run Your Life with Emacs
#+AUTHOR: Peter Prevos

This repository contains my Emacs configuration. =init.el.org= creates the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Init-File.html][init file]] using literate programming in Org Mode.

If you are interested in how to use Emacs to become more productive, then read my [[https://lucidmanager.org/tags/emacs/][blog series]] on this topic.
