#+TITLE: More Productive With Emacs
#+AUTHOR: Peter Prevos

/More Productive with Emacs/ is a [[https://lucidmanager.org/tags/emacs/][series]] of articles on how content creators can use Emacs to research, write and publish articles, websites and books.

The =init.el= file contains the configuration code described in these articles.

* Instructions
** Install Emacs and Decencies
This Emacs configuration requires two other software packages to function properly. For spellchecking you will need the Hunspell package and to use the Org-Roam note taking software you need the GCC compiler.

- Linux: install Emacs and supporting software with your favourite package manager.

- [[https://lucidmanager.org/productivity/emacs-windows/][Windows]]

** Download init file
Download the [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pprevos/EmacsLife/master/init.el][init.el]] file and place it in your configuration folder.

You can find out where your configuration folder lives by starting Emacs and typing =C-h v= for help on variables (Control =h=, followed by =v=), followed by =user-emacs-directory= and =ENTER=.

The help buffer that now appears provides the correct folder name. You can close this buffer by pressing =q=.

** Update folder configuration
This init file defines directories:

- =~/Documents/org-roam=: Notes taken with [[https://lucidmanager.org/productivity/taking-notes-with-emacs-org-mode-and-org-roam/][Org-Roam]]
- =~/Documents/bibliography=: BibTeX files with your [[https://lucidmanager.org/productivity/emacs-bibtex-mode/][BibTeX bibliographies]]
- =~/Documents/pdf=: Bibliography attachments

You can change these settings in the init file.

** Select Fonts
The init file defines two fonts. You will need to adjust the font names to those available on your system. The default setting uses Dejavus Sans.
