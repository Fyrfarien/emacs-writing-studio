This Emacs configuration stays as close as humanly bearable to Vanilla Emacs.

- Leverages functionality in Emacs 29.1
- Standard keyboard shortcuts
- No configuration for developing software
- Centred around Org mode

This is only an early version and will be further developed into a full starter kit for newbie Emacs users who want to write.

To try the /Emacs Writing Studio/, download the ~init.el~ file and run Emacs with the ~--init-directory~ option followed by the folder where =init.el= is located:

~emacs --init-directory path/to/emacs-writing-studio~

The [[https://lucidmanager.org/tags/emacs/][accompanying website]] will eventually be published in an (e)book. The website and the book are written and published with the /Emacs Writing Studio/ Configuration.

Feel free to raise an issue if you have any suggestions on how to enhance the configuration or like to see additional packages useful to authors.
